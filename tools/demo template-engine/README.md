# Template Engine Tools

This directory contains development tools for generating demo content dynamically.

## Files

- `demo_pagegen_eng.js` - Template engine JavaScript
- `demo_pg_temlate.html` - HTML template for dynamic page generation
- `content_template_json` - JSON content structure template

## Purpose

These tools were used to develop the demo content structure and can be used for:
- Rapid prototyping of new demo scenarios
- Content management system development
- A/B testing different content variations

## Usage

These are development tools and are not deployed with the live website. They remain here for future content development and template generation.

## Integration

The current demo implementation uses static HTML files for simplicity and performance. These template tools can be used to generate new demo content or for future dynamic content management.
